# Proportional effect models for continuous outcomes

Longitudinal models that assume Gaussian residuals with proportional treatment group means provide direct estimates of the proportional treatment effect. These models often make a strong assumption regarding a fixed proportional treatment effect overtime which can lead to bias and Type I error inflation. However, we demonstrate that these models are biased and sensitive to the labeling of treatment groups even when the proportional hazards assumption is true. Typically, this bias favors the active group and inflates statistical power.
